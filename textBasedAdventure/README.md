The input you have to start with a certain line such as terminus that is to be decided

to go back one you do cd.. and to go back to the beginning you enter cd home

Classes: We will have classes for each place and we may do more classes if the stories become complicated. We will have Victorian class, a Orthodox priest in europe class, a futruistic class, and a fantasy type era class with more classes for each story if needed. 

To go to each place and enter each class we will give a input within the Main which will enter each class and within main we will do the story for the adventure.
